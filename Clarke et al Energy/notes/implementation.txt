From SI:

Shell conductivity, eta:
- "Rates of shell conductivity improvements of 0.5% per year for undustrialized countries are used, based on estimates of future shell efficiency improvements in the US (EIA 2007)"
- "Higher rates of improvement are assumed for developing countries"
- rates for all regions shown in Fig S3
- need to request from Clark et al

Building floor space calibration and projection
- base year floorspace from lots of datasources, need to ask
- "simple relationship between per capita floor space and per capita income"
- Fig S5

Parameters:
- Table S2
- miu: 
    - Income level at mid-point of satiation curve
    - derived from base year information after all other parameters have been specified
- R:
    - assumed constant in all regions and time periods
