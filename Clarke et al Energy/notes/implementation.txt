From SI:

Shell conductivity, eta:
- "Rates of shell conductivity improvements of 0.5% per year for undustrialized countries are used, based on estimates of future shell efficiency improvements in the US (EIA 2007)"
- "Higher rates of improvement are assumed for developing countries"
- rates for all regions shown in Fig S3
- need to request from Clark et al

Building floor space calibration and projection
- base year floorspace from lots of datasources, need to ask
- "simple relationship between per capita floor space and per capita income"
- Fig S5

Parameters:
- Table S2
- miu: 
    - Income level at mid-point of satiation curve
    - derived from base year information after all other parameters have been specified
- R:
    - assumed constant in all regions and time periods

Calibration of k and miu:
- satiation: set i to infinity, miu drops out, solve for k
    - IG is set to 50% of the sum of all fuel consumption used  for "other" services, modified by a regional scaling factor related to HDD and CDD in that region
    - satiated demand assumptions (d_H* and d_C*) were calculated using USA as benchmark
        - USA are assumed to be 10% higher than the present demand levels in 2010 for both heating and cooling
        - modify other regions
        - d_H* and d_C* will be calculated outside of IAM 
    - what is R??
    - solve for k
- after you have k, solve for miu based on current levels of income and demand
- **solving for k and miu happen outside of and before Clarke et al climate simulations, and would be outside of and before IAM calculations
- **but we may need to redo these calcualtions for different regions
